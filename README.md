- Using Docker Compose
- Using Docker Swarm
- Using Kubernetes

## Building images & Helm chart

Since all the images and Helm chart are already built and available in the OCI registry, you can skip this step.  
Or you can build them yourself by following the instructions below.

### KeyCloak

Review the files under the `config/keycloak` directory, as well as the `keycloak.Dockerfile` file.
The attached files include the following configurations:

- `keycloak.conf`:
  allow to access the KeyCloak by any host without SSL
- `cache-ispn-remote.xml`:
  Infinispan cache provider configuration
- `realms`:
  Directory for importing realms
- `keycloak.Dockerfile`:
  - Install `curl` package for Docker health checks
  - Include the configuration files in the image
  - Enable health checks and metrics
  - Build KeyCloak app for production use ([more info](https://www.keycloak.org/server/containers))

Build the KeyCloak image:

```bash
IMAGE=oshpalov/keycloak-ispn:24.0.3 # Change the image name and tag as needed
docker build -f keycloak.Dockerfile -t $IMAGE .
```

Push the image to the registry:

```bash
docker push $IMAGE
```

### Infinispan

Review the files under the `config/infinispan` directory, as well as the `infinispan.Dockerfile` file.
The attached files include the following configurations:

- `infinispan.xml`:
  Infinispan configuration with the necessary cache stores
- `infinispan.Dockerfile`:
  - Include the configuration file in the image
  - Include additional libs for Infinispan, such as `postgresql`
  - Make a volume for the data directory

Build the Infinispan image:

```bash
IMAGE=oshpalov/infinispan-ispn:15.0.7.Final # Change the image name and tag as needed
docker build -f infinispan.Dockerfile -t $IMAGE .
```

Push the image to the registry:

```bash
docker push $IMAGE
```

### Helm chart

Review the files under the `kubernetes` directory, as well as the `values.yaml` file.

At this point, you can place the KeyCloak realms in the `realms` directory.

Build the Helm chart:

```bash
helm package keycloak-ispn
```

Push the chart to the OCI registry:

```bash
VERSION=$(grep version keycloak-ispn/Chart.yaml | awk '{print $2}')
CHART_URL=oci://registry-1.docker.io/oshpalov/keycloak-ispn # Change the registry URL as needed
helm push keycloak-ispn-$VERSION.tgz $CHART_URL
```

---

## Docker Compose

### Prerequisites

First of all, you have to build the KeyCloak image:

```bash
docker compose build keycloak
```

There are 3 reasons for this:

1. Default KeyCloak image is not meant to be used in production.  
   [Check the official documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/server/containers) for more information.
2. Since we are using Infinispan as a cache provider,  
   we need to pass the `cache-ispn-remote.xml` file to the `build` command.
3. To perform **health checks** on the KeyCloak instances,  
   we need to install the `curl` package in the image.

> **NOTE:** It's not necessary to build Infinispan image,  
> since everything is configured in the `compose.yml` file.

### Running clusters

Copy the `.example.env` file to `.env` and change the values as needed.  

> **NOTE:** If you want to **import existing realms**, you can put the JSON files in the `config/keycloak/realms` directory.  
> KeyCloak will import them automatically when the container starts.

Run the following command to start the clusters:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Wait for the containers to start.
You can check the status of the containers by running:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Output should be similar to this:

```bash

```

After the containers are up, you can access the following URLs:

- KeyCloak: http://localhost:8080/
- Infinispan: http://localhost:11222/
- HAProxy: http://localhost:1936/

Use the credentials defined in the `.env` file to access services.

### Stopping clusters

To stop the clusters, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose down
```

If you want to remove the volumes as well, run:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Kubernetes

### Helm chart

There is a Helm chart available in the `kubernetes` directory.  
To install the chart using CLI, update the `values.yaml` file with the necessary values in the `kc.env` and `ispn.env` sections.

Then run the following command:

```bash
helm install keycloak-ispn \
     --create-namespace \
     --namespace keycloak-ispn \
     --values values.yaml \
     oci://registry-1.docker.io/oshpalov/keycloak-ispn:1.0.0
```

### Accessing services

By default, the services aren't exposed to the outside world.
You can update the `values.yaml` file to expose the services using `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.

Also, you can enable `Ingress` by setting the `kc.ingress.enabled` and `ispn.ingress.enabled` values to `true`.

### Importing realms

There are 3 ways to import realms, depending on the environment:

1. **Using Helm chart and CLI**
   If you're deploying the chart using CLI, you can put the JSON files in the `realms` directory.
   Realms will be included in the chart and imported automatically.
2. **Using Helm chart with GitOps**
   If you're deploying the chart using GitOps, you can still put the JSON files in the `realms` directory.
3. **Using KeyCloak Admin Console**
   If you're deploying packaged Helm chart, you can import realms manually using the KeyCloak Admin Console.
